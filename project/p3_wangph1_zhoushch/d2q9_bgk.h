/*
** Code to implement a d2q9-bgk lattice boltzmann scheme.
** 'd2' inidates a 2-dimensional grid, and
** 'q9' indicates 9 velocities per grid cell.
** 'bgk' refers to the Bhatnagar-Gross-Krook collision step.
**
** The 'speeds' in each cell are numbered as follows:
**
** 6 2 5
**  \|/
** 3-0-1
**  /|\
** 7 4 8
**
** A 2D grid:
**
**           cols
**       --- --- ---
**      | D | E | F |
** rows  --- --- ---
**      | A | B | C |
**       --- --- ---
**
** 'unwrapped' in row major order to give a 1D array:
**
**  --- --- --- --- --- ---
** | A | B | C | D | E | F |
**  --- --- --- --- --- ---
**
** Grid indicies are:
**
**          ny
**          ^       cols(ii)
**          |  ----- ----- -----
**          | | ... | ... | etc |
